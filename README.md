- I used Firebase Authentication for signing in and signing out. User has to create a user to enter the app. Without an account, user will be automatically redirected to the Sign In page. I managed that with Private Route.

- Searching the typed GitHub user and fetching all the informations about user from GitHub API. I did all that with Context. I used higher order JavaScript functions: map(), reduce(), filter() and other reasonable methods like sort(), slice() and Promise.all().
